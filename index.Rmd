These short sessions (45min to 1hr) will be focused on tools and practices for NMFS scientists to help you be **faster, more efficient and organized** in your coding and in merging reports with code. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools. Each session will be stand-alone. While the sessions will be introductory, I will give you links to my GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (and that you can copy and build on).

**About me**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician and I am immersed in R. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research.

## Topics

* Week 1. Introduction to workflow using RStudio and Git/GitHub

* Week 2. Basic coding practices for reproducible and extendible code

* Week 3. Rmarkdown for reports: how to do big tables and export formats for Word docs

* Week 4. Part 1. Organizing your R code into a package

* Week 5. Part 2. Documenting your code and data with Roxygen
