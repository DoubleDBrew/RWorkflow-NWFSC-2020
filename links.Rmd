## Never worked with R?

If you have never worked with R, you can get a basic familiarity by going through [this free tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).  Takes about 4 hours.   

You can also learn R straight from within R using the [swirl package](https://swirlstats.com/).  This doesn't require internet access except to install the package.

Here is another basic R introduction from [ComputerWorld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497143/business-intelligence/business-intelligence-beginner-s-guide-to-r-introduction.html).
