## Never worked with R?

If you have never worked with R, you can get a basic familiarity by going through [this free tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).  Takes about 4 hours.   

You can also learn R straight from within R using the [swirl package](https://swirlstats.com/).  This doesn't require internet access except to install the package.

Here is another basic R introduction from [ComputerWorld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497143/business-intelligence/business-intelligence-beginner-s-guide-to-r-introduction.html).

# Git and GitHub

* [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) Detail on Git and GitHub, but accessible.

# R packages that I use all the time

These are some basic packages that I use all the time. This does not include the analysis packages that I use.

* [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages. I am not a fan of all the tidyverse package and I dislike piping (because it is horribly slow and I need fast), but I try to keep up with the ideas in the "tidyverse" and I try to adopt tidyverse style. In particular, I try to format all my data into tidy format.
* ggplot2: I am not a fan of ggplot, but I use it all the time because it makes plots with many layers so much easier and it makes plot layout easier. I don't like it for my publication quality plots (just too much hassle to get the look I want) but I use it constantly for mock-ups.
* stringr: I work with strings all the time so I always need this.
* dplyr: When I need to go from wide-form to short-form layout, I like it. Definitely I think it is good to inform yourself as to what it does.
* XML: I use it to scrape data from online tables using the `readHTMLTable()` function. I think xml2 in the tidyverse might do the same thing.
* here: This is a handy utility package, along with `file.path()` allows you to make file paths to the base of the project. If you find yourself doing `setwd()` anywhere in your code, you'll want to use `here()` to avoid that because doing that breaks your code for anyone else.
* xtable: Handy for making complex tables.
